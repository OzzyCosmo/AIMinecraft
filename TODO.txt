Main Tasks:
- Make shadows more accurate (done in v0.1.1)
- Add more pause-menu settings (mouse sensitivity, audio toggles)
- Flying (basic N-toggle flight added in v0.1.4; expand with hover UI/energy?)
- Mobs?
- Research and create better lighting (AO + directional sky shading added in v0.1.4; next explore dynamic/global solutions)
- Tools
- Add block breaking audio/particle feedback
- Volumetric cloud performance (v0.1.9 reduced march cost with jitter + lower presets; keep watching for artifacts)

Creative Ideas (made by ai):
- Seasonal biomes with temperature-based foliage changes
- Underground cave networks with glowing crystals
- Craftable gliders for long-distance travel
- Dynamic weather storms that affect gameplay
- NPC villages with simple trading and quests
